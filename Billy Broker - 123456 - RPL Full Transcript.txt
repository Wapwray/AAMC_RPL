Describe a recent regulatory change that impacted you role? What new procedures were introduced and how did these changes affect the way you manage your day-to-day work?



Billy (Attempt 1):
A recent regulatory change that significantly impacted my role was the introduction of the Best Interests Duty (RG 273), which reshaped the way I approach client advice and compliance. To meet these requirements, our compliance team introduced new procedures including mandatory product comparisons, formal BID assessments, a deeper and more targeted fact-find process, and enhanced documentation standards. Previously, recommendations could rely more on general suitability, but now every step must clearly demonstrate that the chosen product is in the client’s best interests. This shift has made my day-to-day work more structured, especially during client meetings where I follow a more detailed and documented workflow. It has strengthened overall compliance, improved the quality of file notes and evidence, and requires me to provide clearer explanations to clients to ensure transparency and alignment with their needs and objectives.

Summary: Your response sufficiently demonstrates an understanding of the impact the regulation change had on the services you offer as a mortgage broker. You have clearly identified that the regulatory shift led to a greater emphasis on long-term suitability, increased reliance on documented evidence, and more detailed assessments to ensure recommendations are appropriate and justifiable.

What impact did the regulation change have on the products or services you offer?

Billy (Attempt 1):
his regulatory shift placed greater emphasis on long‑term suitability when recommending products. Brokers now rely heavily on documented comparison evidence, closer review of Target Market Determinations (TMDs), and detailed assessment of lender policies. This ensures recommendations are appropriate, tailored, and justifiable under BID.

Question 3: How would a regulatory change impact internal and external stakeholders?

Overall assessment: SATISFACTORY.

How would a regulatory change impact internal and external stakeholders? 


Billy (Attempt 1):
Internally, aggregator compliance teams updated templates, workflows, and audit processes to align with RG 273. Externally, lenders revised disclosures, policies, and TMDs to support brokers in meeting their obligations. These changes improved consistency, clarity, and compliance across the lending ecosystem.
