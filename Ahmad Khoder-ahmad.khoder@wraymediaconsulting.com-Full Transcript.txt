-----------------------------
Describe a recent regulatory change that impacted you role? What new procedures were introduced and how did these changes affect the way you manage your day-to-day work?



Ahmad (Attempt 1):
A recent regulatory change that significantly impacted my role was the introduction of the Best Interests Duty (RG 273), which reshaped the way I approach client advice and compliance. To meet these requirements, our compliance team introduced new procedures including mandatory product comparisons, formal BID assessments, a deeper and more targeted fact-find process, and enhanced documentation standards. Previously, recommendations could rely more on general suitability, but now every step must clearly demonstrate that the chosen product is in the client’s best interests. This shift has made my day-to-day work more structured, especially during client meetings where I follow a more detailed and documented workflow. It has strengthened overall compliance, improved the quality of file notes and evidence, and requires me to provide clearer explanations to clients to ensure transparency and alignment with their needs and objectives.
